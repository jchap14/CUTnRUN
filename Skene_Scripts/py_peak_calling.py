    """
    - need to install a more up-to-date varsion of bedtools before invoking Jupyter
      type: module load bedtools/2.21.0
	(1) filters bedgraph based on threshold;
	
	(2) merges adjacent basepairs that are over threshold;
	
  (3) retains peaks that satisfy min/max length criteria; 
	
	(4) merges any peaks that are closer than the inter-peak distance cutoff -or-
  alternatively keeps just the highest peak (this is beta functionality)
	
    - max length is typically defaulted to be very large
    - outputs a bed file (default col4 is the sum of the bedgraph scores; sorted by chrom;start;stop)
    - generate ID: will auto generate a integer list as a ID number (1... number of peaks). This will 
    be reported as column 4 and the bedgraph scores will be shifted to column 5 as per standard bed format
    - note the peak score for merged peak is the *just* the sum of the two individual peaks not the 
    total score in the merged region (i.e. there could be some sub-threshold scores in the intervening 
    space that won't be included)
    -assumes bedgraph in standard format <chr> <start> <stop> <score>
    -output_name = option for user defined name (type with '...'), otherwise will generate name bedgraph_peaks.bed
    -delete_overlap_bed = option to add path to bedfile (as string), whereby any peaks that overlap this bed file will be discarded
